This desaturated-blue-coloured icons theme Suru++ Telinkrin (former Telinkrin Icons Theme) was designed by <a href="http://opendesktop.org/member/455718">Paulxfce</a> and now redesigned and powered by [Gustavo Costa](https://github.com/gusbemacbe) and [Andrea Bonnani](https://github.com/Magog64)'s Suru++. It is designed for users who use Telekrin GTK as desktop theme.

## Known bugs

### Some icons are not correctly applied in some apps

Some apps, as AppImage-buit, Flatpak-built, Snap-built and dpkg-installed apps do not use the relative path of an icon. They use the absolute path of an icon, preventing the icon of being correctly applied. Besides, some apps misuse the icon name, for example, GitHub Desktop uses the icon name called `Icon=desktop`.

We provide desktop files (AppImage, native Debian packages, snap app and source codes) for you for being able of applying correctly the icons. You can download them from the repository <a href="https://github.com/gusbemacbe/suru-plus/tree/master/desktop">Suru++</a>. Copy them to `your_name/local/applications/`, so they won't be reverted to original when you make next updates of Ubuntu and/or PPAs.

We recommend you to back your desktop configuration files up when you intend to make a clean install or reinstall your distribution.
